    Useful, and good story, but a bit lower level than we wanted. strace is
    amazing. There are so many valuable unix tools.

    Kind of disappointing. Did not explain well what the benefits of
    microservices are over a more monolithic service-oriented architecture.
    We are doing some things better, notably including how frequently we
    deploy.

    Some exciting stuff and some dry stuff. Flirted a lot with the
    too-love-level line, but had some good tips. Search term to remember was
    "thing-I-want shape file", which can be easily imported into PostGIS.
    Location is the universal key - you can join anything with anything else by
    querying for "a with x distance of b".

    :+1: Really good. The two talks worked well together, and the main talk had
    a great demo of how to make a block of bad code better. See also the

    Beginning and end were good, kinda bogged down in the middle; too much
    C/C++ stuff. The summary at the end was really valuable. More targetted at
    library/gem APIs than REST APIs.

    Amusing lightning talk; felt a little bit padded. Main talk was good, and
    the speaker was really good. There are some easy things we can do right
    now like filesystem tuning. The gem is no longer maintained and the Ruby
    Enterprise stuff is no longer relevant, but those kinds of ideas might
    still translate.

    "Entertaining speaker, sometimes pretty off-topic, interesting things to say.
    Kinda like somebody's embarassing uncle. Clarifies a bit about how bing works
    - it tends to be a little bit pushier. It's always going to have gamesmanship.
    The presentation layer becomes the gatekeeper."

    "A lot of the Netflix test automation is pretty well-advertised already,
    and some of the rest can be inferred, but there was some really interesting
    stuff in there. The monkey army is run by default, but only during business
    hours. He also introduced the really cool idea of measuring code coverage
