    Well presented, very authentic - only thing missing from his IBM technician
    outfit was a cigarette. The 60s/70s was such a fertile period for computing
    because we didn't know how computers were supposed to work, so we just
    tried everything. The surest barrier to discovering something is thinking
    you already know it. Lots of detailed notes and commentary in the link.

    "Intuition doesn't scale." "Complexity is only a problem when we have to
    deal with it." Lots of nods of agreement throughout. One of the last
    proposed ideas was to hook up and monitor the IDE; this sounds okay in
    theory, if a bit Orwellian, and will the gathered data be useful or noisy?

    "The screen will shape the 21st century the way the car shaped the 20th."
    "Media is an extension of man", "a computer is like a bicycle for the mind"
    in how it amplifies. "What do we want to surround ourselves with?" "Be
    available in response." "Responsiveness is an attitude." "The apps that
    survive are the ones that adapt and respond." What options do our decisions
    open, and what doors do they close? Inspiring talk!
