  comments: >
    Well presented, very authentic - only thing missing from his IBM technician
    outfit was a cigarette. The 60s/70s was such a fertile period for computing
    because we didn't know how computers were supposed to work, so we just
    tried everything. The surest barrier to discovering something is thinking
    you already know it. Lots of detailed notes and commentary in the link.

    "Intuition doesn't scale." "Complexity is only a problem when we have to
    deal with it." Lots of nods of agreement throughout. One of the last
    proposed ideas was to hook up and monitor the IDE; this sounds okay in
    theory, if a bit Orwellian, and will the gathered data be useful or noisy?

    "Media is an extension of man", "a computer is like a bicycle for the mind"

    available in response." "Responsiveness is an attitude." "The apps that

      speaker: Steve Smith

  attendance: 18
  comments: >
    "Release testing segregates authority from responsibility." In tests, you
    want "speed and determinism." This is more targetted at cloud delivery than
    on-prem. It's on both devs and testers to know the impact of changes,
    rather than trying to shake out distant dependencies in release testing.
    Some of our clients might be willing to pick up more frequent changes,
    perhaps in their dev environments.

  comments: >
    A tight feedback loop is critical. From a front-end dev POV, this is
    mindblowing. You can build this in whatever, since it is just a websocket
    and some javascript - the challenge is making sure your javascript stack is
    reloadable. Kinda like Swift Playgrounds, but even more powerful. That
    tight feedback loop is why we build dev mode, because reloading is better
    than redeploying.

  comments: >
    Lambdas are so much cleaner than Guava. We have spent a lot of work to make
    using Guava performant, and much but not all of that would go away with
    lambdas. Groovy seems like it would benefit from some of this, but when
    they were updating to target the Java 8 language level, they found that
    performance was such a moving target that they ended up not using some of
    the new features.

    Hire full stack engineers; get buy-in on (tech) choices; syntax kinda does
    matter - "syntax doesn't matter, especially when you already know it";
    every engineer needs to understand app langauges and cloud tooling; conduct
    positive code reviews; own your problems. Terraform sounds cool, as does
    consul. "Go is a modern language" - what makes it so?

    This seems like fuzz testing, but this does the minimal example, which is

    "Tree + references = graph", except only acyclic graphs. This approach
    evaluates and caches references on the client. They added an escape hatch
    for procedural stuff: a call returns a list of references for the client to
    invalidate in its cache. Netflix has a very simple domain so this works
    really well for them; it probably would not work as well for TE. We do not
    want to build an entire new interface model; we would lose the advantage of
    simple clients we get with HTTP+REST.

    "If you're uncertain, give a range." "Surface risk." Devs all too
    frequently use "time to hello, world" as a metric. Part of kaizen is to
    improve process, but also need to question process. "Sustainably minimize
    lead time to business impact."
  comments: >
    We're actually decent and some of this. Estimates that are too big should
    be broken down into smaller stories, perhaps with research stories ahead of
    further estimation. Beware bundling "research X and implement it", because
    it doesn't allow time to learn and benefit from that knowledge. There is
    tension between "let each person learn/handle the things they are
    interested in" and "avoid silos".

  notes: >
    "You won't ever understand [your OO app] the way you do [your procedural
    app]." Cost for being more OO is higher cognitive load when thinking about
    how the app works. You don't need to understand everything. Long-lived app
    is a kind of shared commons. "Bad programming drives out good."
  comments: >
    Sandi Metz is amazing. Although this is talking about Ruby on Rails, very
    little is ruby- or rails-specific. Blindly following rules is rarely a good
    idea, but it sounds like she's saying the fact of the rules is more
    important than the content of the rules. Part of the team storming and
    norming might be to agree upon the set of rules.

    Make sure you're solving a real problem. Perf _can_ be a real problem.
    Boring choice is stable, reliable, has good tools, you already know it, and

    example. Evaluate by age, usage, average issue age, most recent commit,
    number of stars / watchers, etc. Non-standard tech is expensive: make sure

  notes: >
    Distinguish between "estimates" and "commitments". Communication is always
    key, in QA as in everywhere else. Software is hard; prefer broad design
    skills to platform knowledge; "always be the worst guy in every band you're
    in." Monitoring process is "definition, collection, visualation, action".
    1,000 "no"s for every "yes"; "If you have time to lean, you have time to
    clean." Test and communicate well; trust your team. Schedule pressure is a
    big problem; communication (again!). Delete your code!

      speaker: Rich Smith

  attendance: 18
  notes: >
    People are a part of security. Beware "Security Ego". Enable, don't block,
    or else be routed around. Invest in outreach. "Seed champions" - etsy
    embeds devs in security team for 4 weeks. Lower the barrier to see - be
    accessible and visible. Use blameless postmortems - see also Erik
    Hollnagel. Indicators of an effective security organization: data-driven,
    understands nuance, understands that security is a goal rather than a point;
    runs a bug bounty, which improves the results of pentesters because the low
    hanging fruit is gone and pentesters hate to submit an empty report, and
    feeds QA by directing attention to the areas were bugs are most frequently
    found; doesn't cry wolf, and has security engineers in the codebase instead
    of on the sidelines; makes realistic tradeoffs, understands '"no"s are a
    finite resource'; provides context and impact; recognizes and rewards;
    treats security as a brand, and gets people to buy in. DevSecOps!

    Focus management is curating the keyboard tab experience; try just tabbing
    through a site. Color contrast is important, and there are standards around
    this. Check out gov.uk for a site that exemplifies focus management but
    needs a bit of work on color contrast. WAI-ARIA is a W3C Recommendation.
    Look at the automated tests in the Chrome GitHub organization. Look at
    Protractor for end-to-end testing.

    We should build our own docker / vagrant files - or we do, and we should do
    that more.  "Security people are jerks" - rather than just saying
    everything's awful, need to give enough information about problems to have
    a risk/cost discussion with the business.  There's an analogue here to QA:
    you can say "it's broken and this is awful" or "this checkbox is
    backwards"; one is more useful than the other.  Bug bounty? Need to do a
    lot of prep work first.
